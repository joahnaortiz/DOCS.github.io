Data objects are composed of templates, which in turn, are composed of fields. As a different way of handling business data and parameters, data objects are attached to the screen for a more efficient process of retrieving and storing data. Using data objects, a group of fields from one function may be used and reused in another product function.\nWith the full and proficient utilization of data objects, CE can support multi-layer and one-to-many transactions.\n+———————————————————————–+ | Data Models for Data Objects | | | | [One-to-Many Data Model]{.underline} | | | | The one-to-many data model allows the system to associate one entity | | to several occurrences in another entity. | | | | {width=\"1.3791666666666667in” | | height=\"1.0805555555555555in”} | | | | [Multi-Layered Data Model]{.underline} | | | | The multi-layered data model allows the data, contained in the DO | | templates, to be arranged into different or multiple layers. | | | | {width=\"3.8722222222222222in” | | height=\"2.151388888888889in”} | +———————————————————————–+\nManual Overview [Purpose]{.underline}\nThis manual serves as a reference for creating and utilizing a data object in the CE system. The chapters provide details on how to build data object templates and data object entities, and how to attach these to the transaction function screen.\n This document is written with the assumption that:\n   The CE environment has already been successfully installed; and\n  The reader has sufficient knowledge on building a CE product and\n running the CE Utility functions.\n   [Audience]{.underline}\nThis manual is a reference specifically for, but not limited to, the following users:\n  Consultants responsible for creating and configuring data objects and modifying data object screens. These users must have sufficient knowledge of running EE Utility functions and building EE modules\n  Bank or browser-side users tasked to process transactions involving screens with data objects\n  [Prerequisites]{.underline}\n Recommended reading materials before reading this manual:    CE Building a Product\n  CE Utility References\n  {width=\"0.3333333333333333in” height=\"0.3333333333333333in”}NOTE: Some features discussed in this manual have been tested and documented based on an older system version. Unless otherwise specified, the overall functionality is the same when recreated in the current version.\nUsing the CE Utility   Running the CE Utility\n  Generating the XML Parameter FILES\n  BUILDING A PRODUCT\n   Running the CE Utility The Customer Enterprise Utility Workbench, or CE Utility, is the main tool for building parameters in CE.\nPreparing the CE Utility Files  Along with the installation files, the CE Utility folder is provided with every CE system release.

One step is the GAP analysis which involves an evaluation of transaction requirements, based on the process flow (e.g., fields, clauses, forms, and interfaces). These are necessary for identifying the fields required for anticipating the required output. When the analysis has been completed, the project team can now begin the process of building a product for the bank’s customers.\nThe following are steps in building a product:\n  Access the CE Utility. To access the CE Utility for building parameters, an Operator user must be created by an Administrator user. This is set up through the User Manager function in the User Manage function group.\n  Set up the module and events. This involves naming the module and the projected events that manage the transaction flow within the module. This is set up in the Module and Event function in CE Utility.\n  Set up the transaction tables. This involves creating the tables in the DB Dictionary function in CE Utility. There can be different types of tables but only three are mandatory for a CE module: master, ledger, and event.\n  {width=\"0.3333333333333333in” height=\"0.3333333333333333in”}NOTE: It is possible to create tables directly into the database by running SQL scripts in the database. In this case, tables can be created before modules and events. It is recommended, however, to use the DB Dictionary for creating tables.\n Add fields to the transaction table. Fields must be added to a transaction table and field properties defined for the processing and storage of data. These can be done through the DB Dictionary function in CE Utility.\n  Set up the transaction functions. This involves creating the functions that correspond to actual business transaction processes. This is done through Transaction Function in the Transaction Function group.\n  Set up the transaction parameters. This involves designing the transaction screen, defining attribute and catalog settings, and attaching these parameters to the transaction function. These can be done through Transaction Function in CE Utility.\n  Create the product. The product is the actual functionality accessed and run by the end-user. This process of creating a product involves setting up the product group, product, and product function, and defining product catalog settings.\n  Define authorization rules. Authorization rules are set to further define or set limits for authorizing transactions.\n  Calculation. This involves configuring the transaction JS files and defining calculation functions using available system methods. There are three JS files that have to be configured: the Module Base JS file, Event JS file, and Function JS file.\n  Define the settings for the transaction input. Certain functions may be added to aid in the input of data into the transaction. The CE Utility provides options for setting up field conversion rules, lookup buttons, customer reference numbers, clauses, dropdown lists, and data objects for this purpose.\n  Define the settings for the transaction output. Some business transactions involve output generation (i.e., Forms). To make this option available, certain settings must be configured using the functions from the Transaction Function group in CE Utility.\n  Define the security settings in the CE browser. The products and functions created are assigned to an end-user through the browser-side Security and System Maintenance functions.\n  {width=\"0.3333333333333333in” height=\"0.3333333333333333in”}NOTE: The browser-side security and system maintenance functions of CE are often collectively called the Security Module.\nAdd the Inbox functionality. Another way of accessing a product or a transaction for further processing is through the Customer Inbox. This can be set up through the Inbox function in CE Utility.  {width=\"0.3333333333333333in” height=\"0.3333333333333333in”}NOTE: For more details on configuring different parameters in CE, refer to the CE Utility Reference manuals*.*\nDefining Data Objects   DEFINING data objects\n  using data objects in a product function\n  Defining Data Objects A data object, which may also be referred to as a data object entity, is a logical object that has its own calculation rules. Being a reusable component, it reduces the amount of work when building an effective business module. A data object is composed of one or more templates, which, in turn, are composed of fields and attached to a screen.\nTo attach the data object functionality to a product function, eight stages are involved:\n  Designing the data object screen\n  Adding the data object fields\n  Configuring the data object template\n  Configuring the data object entity\n  Attaching the data object to module tables\n  Reformatting the related transaction table\n  Attaching the data object to the transaction screen\n  Generating DO-related XML Files\n  The look and feel of a data object depends on the DO template file used. The two ways by which a data object can be displayed on the transaction screen are:\n  Tree UI Style\n  Simple (IFrame) UI Style\n  {width=\"0.3333333333333333in” height=\"0.3333333333333333in”}NOTE: The Tree UI Style is currently not supported in the CE Baseline.\nWhen a data object is added to module functions, a grid is displayed, which contains the data object records. The user may manipulate (e.g., add, edit, delete) records from this grid using the available data object buttons.\n{width=\"0.33194444444444443in” height=\"0.33194444444444443in”}NOTE:\ni. For data objects with more than three (3) layers, it is recommended that the Tree type of DO user interface be used.\nii. To configure the buttons to be displayed in the data object grid at runtime, refer to the Data Object Buttons discussion in this chapter for more details.\nUsing Data Objects in a Product Function A data object is used during transaction processing oftentimes to support transactions with multiple records. Furthermore, a data object has the capability to store and retrieve data from one transaction screen to another.\nThe following steps demonstrate how a data object is applied or used in a product function at runtime. The succeeding chapter discusses how CE parameters and JSP settings are configured to enable the DO functionality.\n{width=\"0.33194444444444443in” height=\"0.33194444444444443in”}NOTE: In browser processing, the DO entity is simply referred to as a data object; and the DO template as child data object.\nDO Product Function: Simple UI Style +———————–+———————–+———————–+ | Example | | | +=======================+=======================+=======================+ | 1.

This data object screen is attached to the data object template, which is the basis for creating the data object entity (or data object). The data object screen is displayed once the corresponding button in the data object grid is clicked on during transaction processing.\nThe corresponding JSP file for the data object screen defines the look and feel as the data object is displayed in the transaction screen. The data object JSP files are stored on the following path in the CEWeb.war folder:\n[CEWeb.war]\\[Bank]\\[Country]\\WEB\\SCRN\\DO\n{width=\"0.33194444444444443in” height=\"0.33194444444444443in”}NOTE:\n i. A data object template, as discussed in the next chapter, consists of fields and/or groups of fields. While it is common for the DO screen and the DO template to contain the same fields, the DO screen typically has fewer fields than the DO template. In addition, extension fields can be added to a DO screen and not to a DO template.\nii. For DO configurations using the CE New Utility (i.e., the PARA_FILE_FORMAT system parameter is set to NU), the screen path is \\CEWeb.war\\Default\\SCRN\\DO. Refer to the CE New Utility set of manuals.\n Configuration  When designing the data object screen, the following codes must be included in the data object JSP file:\n   EXIMTAGS and CETAGS codes\n  SubPage Oninit() script\n  Procedure  Do the following . . . +———————–+———————–+———————–+ | 1.

It may be composed of fields and/or other data object templates. A DO template can be shared by or used in several data objects.\nThe kinds of DO templates are based on the storage type of the data object that is to use the template. These are:\n  FDO Templates\n  TDO Templates\n  XDO Templates\n  {width=\"0.3333333333333333in” height=\"0.3333333333333333in”}NOTE: A data object template determines the columns in the data object grid. These columns may either be displayed or hidden in the data object grid.\n{width=\"4.941345144356956in” height=\"1.344932195975503in”}\nFDO Templates  In FDO (or Field Data Object) Templates, the content of the corresponding data object is stored in the fields of the related transaction table.\nAn FDO may be used as a child template of a TDO template but it cannot have a TDO as its child template. In cases when it is used as a child of a TDO template, the content of the FDO is stored in the fields on the standalone table related to the parent TDO template.\n ####### Configuration\n The relevant settings must be defined in the Data Object Template window to create an FDO template.\n Step 1: Storage Window\nThe following fields are provided in the Data Object Template – Step 1 Window.\n+———————————————————————–+ | +——————————————————————+ | | | ————————————————————– | | | | ———- | | | | {width=\"4.85in” height=\"2.96736111111 | | | | 1111in”} | | | | ————————————————————– | | | | ———- | | | +——————————————————————+ | +———————————————————————–+\nFigure 4.

These templates may be composed of a field, a group of fields or other templates. The data object is then attached to a sub-page of the main transaction function screen.\nIn CE, there are two kinds of data object entities:\n  Data object entity with a non-template root node: This data object may be based on one or several DO templates.\n  Data object entity with a template root node: This data object is based on only one main DO template.\n  {width=\"0.33194444444444443in” height=\"0.33194444444444443in”}NOTE:\ni. Data objects with a non-template root node are often used in transaction functions that utilize the Tree user interface style. Data objects with a template root node are often used in transaction functions that utilize the Simple user interface style.\nii. In the browser-side transaction processing, a data object entity is simply referred to as a data object, while a DO entity’s templates are referred to as child data objects.\n#######\nDO Entities with a Non-Template Root Node A data object entity with a non-template root node pertains to a data object that is based on one or several DO templates.\n####### Configuration\n The relevant settings must be defined in the Data Object Dialog window to create a data object entity with a non-template root node.

To be able to add a data object entity with a field already existing in the module table, either remove the field from the module table or modify the DO entity and delete the duplicate field (i.e., remove the field from the attached FDO template).\n     As the content of a TDO data object entity is stored in a standalone\n table, the system does not check for duplicate fields when this DO entity is added to a table.\n   As the content of an XDO data object entity is stored in a CLOB\n field, the system does not check for duplicate fields when this DO entity is added to a table. However:\n   The CLOB field associated with an XDO template, to which the\n fields and child templates are stored, cannot be added as a separate transaction field to a table that already contains a data object entity that includes the same XDO template; and vice versa.\n   A table cannot contain two or more data object entities that\n contain the same XDO template as they utilize the same CLOB field.\n   A table can contain an XDO template which associated CLOB field\n is added as a child field of another XDO template that is also included in the same table. (This second XDO template is associated with another CLOB field to which its child fields – including the CLOB field related to the first XDO template – and templates are stored.)\n     Procedure To attach the data object to module tables:\n Do the following . . . +———————–+———————–+———————–+ | 1.

This menu displays the data objects attached to the module table and the records added to the corresponding data object.\nTo apply the Tree UI Style, the SYS_Tree_DO_Template.jsp file must be attached to the transaction function.\nThis file is stored on the following path of the CEWeb.war folder:\n [CEWeb.war]:\\Templates\n {width=\"0.33194444444444443in” height=\"0.33194444444444443in”}NOTE:\ni.

With the help of internet technology, CE is especially designed to allow customers to do business and participate in the business process without being physically present at the bank. Making use of supplementary functionalities, CE may be interfaced with Eximbills Enterprise and CS Eximbills. The system utilizes three main physical components: the database server, the application server, and the web server.\nThe Customer Enterprise Utility Workbench, or CE Utility, is the main parameter-setting tool of the CE system. It is used to define parameters and rules that are required to successfully carry out business processes and operations, and system tasks. Parameters instruct the system on how to control, manage, and process the business data that it receives. The parameters are written into the background database or saved in the Application and Web servers as XML documents to be used for system operations.\nGeneral issues and information about the Customer Enterprise system and the CE Utility are discussed in this reference.\n{width=\"0.3375in” height=\"0.3375in”}NOTE: Refer to the Customer Enterprise documentations for detailed information on the CE system.\n{#section-2 .CS-head1}\nManual Overview  [Purpose]{.underline}\nThis document addresses commonly-asked questions on the Customer Enterprise system. Issues on the browser-side (transaction processing), CE Utility, Security Module, and database, among others, are addressed in the discussions.\n[Audience]{.underline}\nThis manual is a reference specifically for, but not limited to, the following users:\n   Users assigned to build modules or troubleshoot parameter errors\n  Users assigned to troubleshoot runtime errors\n  Users with sufficient knowledge of installing a CE environment, using the different CE and CE Utility functions, and configuring CE parameters\n   [Prerequisites]{.underline}\nIn depth knowledge of the system, as also presented and detailed in the following manuals, is recommended:\n   CE Core Manuals\n  CE Utility References\n  CE Installation Guides\n  {width=\"0.3333333333333333in” height=\"0.3333333333333333in”}NOTE: Some features discussed in this manual have been tested and documented based on an older system version. Unless otherwise specified, the overall functionality is the same when recreated in the current version.\n{#section-3 .CS-ChapterTitle}\nBrowser-side Issues   CREATING THE SUPER OFFICER USER PROFILE\n  CECHECKCHARACTERFILTER ERROR\n  INBOX OR DETAIL INFO ERROR MESSAGE\n  INBOX NOT WORKING PROPERLY\n  DOWNLOADING TRANSACTION DATA ON WEBLOGIC\n  MODIFIED LBI FILES\n  SUPPORTING MULTI-LANGUAGES\n  SESSION TIMEOUT AND AUTO SAVE\n  SESSION EXTENSION AND RELATED SETTINGS\n  CANCEL BUTTON ISSUE\n  Uploading Files or Images\n  AUTHORIZATION NOT WORKING\n  SETTING THE DATE FORMAT\n  EC LEDGER ERROR\n  DISABLE CACHE\n  MANUALLY STOP/START THE WEBSPHERE SERVICE\n  BROWSER LOGON INFORMATION\n  Chrome Browser Settings\n  IE9 Browser SEttings\n  Displaying the Last Logon Failure\n  Browser navigation limitations\n  MULTIPLE AUTHORIZATION FUNCTIONS IN ONE PRODUCT\n  DISPLAY ERROR WHEN PRINTING HISTORICAL RECORDS\n  DISPLAY ALL RECORDS FOR INQUIRE CUBK\n  DISALLOWING THE SYSTEM LOGIN GET METHOD\n  {#section-4 .CS-head1}\n{#section-5 .CS-head1}\nCreating the Super Officer User Profile To create the default Super Officer user profile, run this SQL Insert statement:\n(Start of code)\n INSERT INTO CEUSER.SEC_USER_INFO ( SEC_USER_INFO.C_BK_GROUP_ID, SEC_USER_INFO.C_UNIT_CODE, SEC_USER_INFO.C_USER_ID, SEC_USER_INFO.C_USER_DESC, SEC_USER_INFO.C_PASSWORD, SEC_USER_INFO.I_USER_TYPE, SEC_USER_INFO.I_AUTH_LEVEL, SEC_USER_INFO.I_AUTH_TYPE, SEC_USER_INFO.C_DFLT_UNIT_CODE, SEC_USER_INFO.C_DATE_FORM, SEC_USER_INFO.C_TMPL_PROTECT, SEC_USER_INFO.C_LOG_TYPE, SEC_USER_INFO.C_HAVE_AUTH, SEC_USER_INFO.C_AUTH_SET, SEC_USER_INFO.C_LOGIN_RULE, SEC_USER_INFO.C_LOCKED_FLAG, SEC_USER_INFO.C_FAP_SET, SEC_USER_INFO.C_CNTY_CODE, SEC_USER_INFO.C_LANG_NAME, SEC_USER_INFO.C_LANG_VAL, SEC_USER_INFO.C_LOCKED_OP, SEC_USER_INFO.T_LOCKED_TIME, SEC_USER_INFO.EFFECTIVE_DATE, SEC_USER_INFO.EXPIRY_DATE, SEC_USER_INFO.I_EXPIRY_TYPE, SEC_USER_INFO.I_MULTI_LOGIN, SEC_USER_INFO.C_ADD_FLAG, SEC_USER_INFO.C_TRX_STATUS, SEC_USER_INFO.C_CREATED_BU, SEC_USER_INFO.C_CREATED_BY, SEC_USER_INFO.C_GRP_CODE, SEC_USER_INFO.C_CURRENCY, SEC_USER_INFO.I_SEC_TYPE, SEC_USER_INFO.D_CREATED_DATE, SEC_USER_INFO.C_CHANGE_PSW, SEC_USER_INFO.I_LOGON_RETRIES, SEC_USER_INFO.C_INACTIVE, SEC_USER_INFO.C_FIRST_PWD, SEC_USER_INFO.C_LAST_PWD, SEC_USER_INFO.C_USER_MAIL )\nVALUES ( 'CSBANK', 'CSOFFICE', 'superofficer', 'The Super Officer', '11111111', 0, 1, 0, NULL, 'yyyy-mm-dd', NULL, NULL, 'F', NULL, NULL, 'F', 'T', 'US', NULL, NULL, 'superofficer', TO_DATE('2005/12/08 12:51:46', 'YYYY/MM/DD HH24:MI:SS'), NULL, NULL, 1, 0, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'CSOFFICE', NULL, NULL, TO_DATE('2007/03/09 00:00:00', 'YYYY/MM/DD HH24:MI:SS'), 'F', 0, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL )\n (End of code)\n{#section-6 .CS-head1}\nCECheckCharacterFilterError Issue\nOn a new environment, this error occurs when loading a transaction screen: ‘Error 500: Filter [CECheckCharacterFilter]: Filter is unavailable’.\nSolution\nAdd the following parameter in the [CE Parameter Folder]\\CE_SYS folder.\n characterfilter.xml  Inbox or Detail Info Error Message Issue\nThe system cannot display the inbox, or the ‘Detail Info’ error message is shown.\n  Figure 2.

In the Process Definition – Configuration screen, click on the Java Virtual Machine property. Click on the Custom Properties option and create the following setting:\n Field Description\n  **Name ** Specify this value: client.encoding.override\nValue Specify this value: UTF-8\nDescription Specify the language to be supported in this field (e.g., Chinese).\n   Figure 2. Example: Supporting the Chinese Language\nSession Timeout and Auto Save The timeout and auto save functionality for CE transactions are set in CE Utility.\nThe session timeout is defined in the SESSION_TIMEOUT system parameter (under the Web Server parameter type). The unit is in minutes, and the value must be greater than 1, as the system prompts a warning message one minute before it has to time out\n  Figure 2. SESSION_TIMEOUT System Parameter\nThe generated XML file for this system parameter is in:\n[Parameter Path]\\CSBANK\\US\\WEB\\SYST\\sysparam.xml\nThe Value setting in the SESSION_TIMEOUT node must be in capitals, ‘VALUE’; otherwise, the system cannot recognize the defined value and defaults it to 30.\n{#section-11 .CS-head1}\nSession Extension and Related Settings During transaction processing, a warning message is shown when a session is about to expire. Through this message, a user may opt to extend the session, otherwise, due to inactivity, the transaction is automatically saved and the user automatically logged off the CE system when the session expires. This warning message may be shown either through a popup window or through a float layer.\nOriginally, a popup window is displayed to enable users to extend the session. However, this popup window may only be made available in transaction modules. In addition, some browser types block this popup window causing the user to be unaware of session expiry and thus encountering an exception during processing.\nIn order to fully utilize the extend session feature in transaction, security, standing and system modules, the extend session warning message must be shown through the use of float layer.\n{width=\"0.3333333333333333in” height=\"0.3333333333333333in”}NOTE:\nWhen using the extend session feature:\ni. In the security, standing, and system modules, transactions are not automatically saved once a session expires.\nii. In transaction modules, transactions processed in pending functions are automatically saved once a session expires.\nConfiguration\nTo enable the use of float layer for extend session warning messages, the following configurations must be performed:\n  Modify the web.xml file. This file is stored on the following path:\n[CEWeb.war folder]\\WEB-INF\n   Add a new mapping for this filter: CEVerifySessionFilter  +——————————————————–+ | \u003cfilter-mapping id=\"FilterMapping_1138957604797\"\u003e | | | | \u003cfilter-name\u003eCEVerifySessionFilter\u003c/filter-name\u003e | | | | \u003cservlet-name\u003eWSSTrxManager\u003c/servlet-name\u003e | | | | \u003c/filter-mapping\u003e | | | | \u003cfilter-mapping\u003e | | | | \u003cfilter-name\u003eCEVerifySessionFilter\u003c/filter-name\u003e | | | | \u003cservlet-name\u003eWSGetDataSSScript\u003c/servlet-name\u003e | | | | \u003c/filter-mapping\u003e | +——————————————————–+\n Add the WSSessionTimeOutManage servlet and define its mapping.  +———————————————————————–+ | \u003cservlet\u003e | | | | \u003cservlet-name\u003eWSSessionTimeOutManage\u003c/servlet-name\u003e | | | | \u003cdisplay-name\u003eWSSessionTimeOutManage\u003c/display-name\u003e | | | | \u003cdescription\u003e\u003c/description\u003e | | | | \u003cservlet-class\u003ecom.cs.eximweb.servlets.WSSessionTimeOutManage\u003c/ser | | vlet-class\u003e | | | | \u003c/servlet\u003e | +———————————————————————–+\n+—————————————————————–+ | \u003cservlet-mapping\u003e | | | | \u003cservlet-name\u003eWSSessionTimeOutManage\u003c/servlet-name\u003e | | | | \u003curl-pattern\u003e/servlets/WSSessionTimeOutManage\u003c/url-pattern\u003e | | | | \u003c/servlet-mapping\u003e | +—————————————————————–+\nLog on to the CE Utility as a super administrator user and set the value of the EXTEND_SESSION_LAYER security system parameter to TRUE.   This parameter is used to control how the extend session notification is to be displayed: through a popup window or a float layer. It may have any of the following values:\n   TRUE, in which a float layer is shown as a notification for extending the session. This is made available in transaction, security, standing, and system modules.\n  FALSE, in which the standard logic is applied and a popup window is displayed as a notification for extending the session. This is made available in pending transactions only. This is the default value.\n     Log on to the CE Utility as an administrator or operator user and generate the xml files for the Security System Parameter. The sys_para.xml file is generated on the following path:\n [Parameter folder]\\CE_SYS\\SYST\n  Log on the CE Utility as an administrator or operator user. In the System Parameter function, make sure that the value of the SESSION_TIMEOUT Web Server system parameter is less than or equal to the session timeout value of the application server.

Image Control Function\nOn the other hand, the total size of all uploaded images can be controlled through the ALL_IMAGE_LENGTH parameter. This setting is defined in the System Parameter function of the Parameter Manage function group.\n  Figure 2. ALL_IMAGE_LENGTH System Parameter\nTransaction Processing  During transaction processing, clicking the Upload Image button on the transaction function screen opens the Image(s) Information window. Images and other files can be uploaded and managed in this window.\n   Figure 2. Uploading an Image\n A warning message is displayed when the file being uploaded has an unsupported file type. The upload process is then terminated.\n   Figure 2. Invalid File Type Warning Message\n If the size of the file being uploaded exceeds the maximum size allowed, the upload is stopped and a warning message is displayed as well.\n   Figure 2. Invalid File Size Warning Message\n{#section-14 .CS-head1}\nAuthorization Not Working Issue\nThe authorization rule is not followed.\nA function, with an AP type and with the Release flag unchecked, is run and the transaction is confirmed. However, the transaction is not queued to the authorization function.\nSolution\nNote the following points when setting an authorization rule:\n  An Amount field in the screen must be linked to this authorization rule (through the Product Authorize function in CE Utility);\n  The value of this amount field in the transaction screen must not be null and must be greater than zero.\n  The Amount/Rate format for the related pending function has to be set.\n  {#section-15 .CS-head1}\nSetting the Date Format When a transaction is run, the process flows from the application server (AP), to the web server (Web), and back to the application server.\nWhen retrieving data from AP to display it on Web (AP to Web), CE converts the date format from the system format (YYYY-MM-DD) to the user-defined one using the SYS_CONVERT_DISPLAY_DATE() system JS function. The SYS_DateFormat.js file is the system level js function that is used to format date value.\nWhen the transaction is submitted (Web to AP), CE converts the user-defined format to the system format using the SYS_CONVERT_SYSTEM_DATE() system JS function.\nThe following conditions must be satisfied in order to set up a date format:\n  The two JS functions can convert the format automatically as long as the CLASS attribute of a field begins with a ‘DATE_'.\n  Before a date-type field is converted, it must first have the proper date format: if the date value is to be changed from the system format to the user-defined one, it must first be in system format; conversely, a date value must first be in the user-defined format if it is to be changed to the system format.\n  {width=\"0.3375in” height=\"0.3375in”}NOTE: The Date Format setting (i.e., the C_DATE_FORM field), is set in the company group level (using the Add Company Group function in the Security Module).\nEC Ledger Error Issue\nThe ‘EC ledger’ error occurs when a transaction for a Trx Manager EC-type function is confirmed.\n  Figure 2. EC Ledger Error Message\nSolution\nFor functions assigned with the Trx Manager EC main program (e.g., Modify LC), it is not required to set any function attribute. The system retrieves the attributes of the preceding or original function of the selected record via function Id (e.g., Apply for LC).\nNote the value of the EVENT parameter (e.g., \u003cEVENT\u003eMASTER\u003c/EVENT\u003e); this is used to retrieve the table name and to get value of I_EVENT_TIMES. If the EVENT parameter is incorrect, the value of I_EVENT_TIMES becomes null and, consequently, the EC Ledger error occurs.\nTo correct this error, check the Attribute component of the original function and make sure that the Event Name property is set to MASTER.\n  Figure 2. Function Attribute – Event Name\n{#section-16 .CS-head1}\nDisable Cache Cache Manage can be disabled in CE, open the WebSphere – Administrative Console and access the application server (e.g., Server1). In the Process Definition – Configuration screen, click on the Java Virtual Machine property. Click on the Custom Properties option and create the following setting:\n Field Description\n  **Name ** Specify this value: ce.cache.disabled\nValue Specify this value: true\n   Figure 2. Example: Disable Cache\n{#section-17 .CS-head1}\nManually Stop/Start the WebSphere Service The following instances require the manual running of the stop/start process for the WAS service.\n  After installing the CE.ear file;\n  After modifying the parameters of CE in the WAS console;\n  After modifying the setting of JDBC provider and data source; and\n  After replacing the JAR files and the class files of CE.\n  There are three ways to run the stop/start process for the WebSphere service:\n In the Windows Control Panel, run the Services option from the Administrative Tools folder. In the Services window, select the IBM WebSphere application and click on the stop, start or restart options for the service.   {width=\"5.03125in” height=\"2.8714227909011374in”}\n{width=\"4.9468318022747155in” height=\"2.4716983814523186in”}\n Access the IBM WebSphere Application Server menu from the Windows Programs group. Click on the Stop/Start the Server option from the relevant profile sub-menu of the Profile folder.    In the Enterprise Applications page of the WebSphere Administrative console, select the CE program and click on the stop/start service option.    Browser Logon Information In the Browser Logon window, the Company Code field is the value of the Company Group code. If a customer has no specified company group, the system designates the company code value as the company group value.\n  Figure 2.

Select the relevant record. In the dropdown list for More Actions, select the View Historical option and click on the Go button.    In the screen that is displayed, select the record and click on the Select button.    Details of the record are shown. Click on the Print button.    The preview screen displays improper style and placement of fields. Log off the CE system.     Open the Trx_Template.jsp file. This file is stored on the following path:\n[CEWeb.war folder]\\Templates\nRemove or disable the following script:\n\u003cEXIMTAGS:IncludeFile filePath=\"../JS/SYS_InqCUBK.js\"/\u003e\n    After updating this JSP file, generate the XML file for the Screen parameter in the CE Utility.\nLog on to the CE system. View and print the same transaction. The preview screen then displays the proper style and placement of fields.    Display All Records For Inquire CUBK  During transaction processing, search buttons may be used to inquire on the available CUBK records for the relevant field. However, once a record is selected and the search button is again clicked on, only the already selected record is displayed on the inquiry list. All available records are only displayed once the reset button is clicked on.\nSample Processing and Solution:\n In the CE Utility, the CUBK rule is defined. This rule is then attached to the relevant search button on the screen (e.g., for Beneficiary Bank).      Log on to the CE system and run the Apply for Import LC function. Click on the relevant Search button to inquire on the available beneficiary banks.    A window is displayed listing the available banks. Select a record by clicking on the Bank ID (e.g., BANK001).    The values are retrieved in the relevant fields. Click on the Search button for beneficiary bank again.    Only the details of the already selected record (e.g., BANK001) are displayed on the list.    [NOTE:]{.underline}\nThe Reset link must first be clicked on to remove the already selected record in order to display all available bank records in the inquire list.\n  Log off the CE system.\n Modify the Tautocomplete.js file.

The reactivation process depends on the system’s configuration. Two processes are available:\n  Manual Reactivation\n  Auto-reactivation\n  {width=\"0.3333333333333333in” height=\"0.3333333333333333in”}NOTE: Manual reactivation is always available. On the other hand, auto-reactivation is available only when it is enabled.\nManual Reactivation  The system’s default settings require the locked out user to be manually reactivated by a user that has access to the Security module.\n  EXAMPLE +———————–+———————–+———————–+ | 1.

To enable this feature, the following parameters must be defined or modified in the CE Utility:\n  UNLOCKTIME global system parameter\n  Error code 000310\n  {width=\"0.3333333333333333in” height=\"0.3333333333333333in”}NOTE: The system can only automatically reactivate user accounts that are deactivated by exceeding its maximum number of failed logon attempts. Accounts that are locked out for any other reason are not automatically reactivated.\nParameter Setting\nTo enable auto-reactivation, the global system parameter UNLOCKTIME must be defined. This parameter is used to specify the time (in minutes) that the user account remains locked out before it is automatically reactivated. During this time, the user cannot log on to the system even when using the correct logon details. When the specified time has elapsed, the user can try to log on to the system again.\nTo configure this system parameter, log on to the CE Utility as Super Administrator user and access the System Parameters function in the Parameter Manage group.\n  Figure 4. UNLOCKTIME System Parameter\nThe UNLOCKTIME global system parameter may have any of the following values:\n Parameter Value Description\n +———————–+———————–+———————–+ | **0 ** | | The auto-reactivate | | | | feature is not | | | | enabled.

When the Auto-reactivation feature is disabled, this error message instructs the locked out user to contact the bank administrator for reactivation. If the Auto-reactivation feature is enabled, error message 000310 must be configured to instruct the user to wait for a specified amount of time before the account gets reactivated automatically.\n{width=\"0.3333333333333333in” height=\"0.3333333333333333in”}NOTE: The error message 000135 is the default error message for unexpected exception. It provides a general message to the user, which can apply to all exceptions.\nModify the configuration of the error message 000310 through the Error Handling function in the Maintenance group of the CE Utility.\n  Figure 4.

The usual logon issues that may be encountered are often of the following types:\n  Logon Information Issues;\n  User Profile Status Issues; and\n  Password Issues\n  {width=\"0.3333333333333333in” height=\"0.3333333333333333in”}NOTE:\n i. For the complete information on CE security settings and the Security module, refer to the CE Security and System Maintenance Functions manual.\nii. The system can be configured in such a way that password verification rules (e.g., limit for the period of inactivity) for bank users are different from that of company users. For details on this configuration, refer to the Password Validation Rules topic of this chapter.\n Logon Information Issues  In the CE Logon screen, the user profile’s company code, logon Id, and password are required to be specified to access the system. If any of the logon information provided is incorrect, an error message is displayed and the user is denied access. The same goes when the specified company code or logon Id does not exist in the database. The user can return to the Logon screen and provide the correct logon information.\nPassword issues are discussed separately in this topic.\n {#section-34 .CS-head2}\nUser Profile Status Issues  Access to the system is denied to a user profile that is inactive for too long, not yet effective, already expired, or currently logged on in a different machine.\n User Profile Inactive for too Long  A user profile automatically gets suspended when the account has not been logged on the CE system for a period longer than the maximum number of days allowed for inactivity. When the details of the suspended user profile are viewed in the Security module through the Inquire SSO, Inquire Admin, or Inquire Operator functions, the Inactive/ Suspended flag of the Advanced Security Information section is marked. Unmarking this flag grants the corresponding user access to the system again.\n {width=\"0.3333333333333333in” height=\"0.3333333333333333in”}NOTE: The limit for the period of inactivity is defined through the MAX_INACTIVE_DAYS security system parameter.\nUser Profile Not Yet Effective  When a user is created in the Security module, it is mandatory to specify the value of the Effective Date field, which refers to the date when the new user profile can be used. If a new user attempts to log on to CE before this date, an error message is displayed and the system denies the user access.\n User Profile Already Expired  Once a user profile expires, it cannot be used to log on to CE anymore. The expiry date is specified in the Expiry Date field when the profile is created or modified in the Security module. This information can be viewed through the Inquire SSO, Inquire Admin, or Inquire Operator functions.\nThe affected user can contact the bank administrator to request for the reactivation of the expired account. The administrator can then set the expiry date at a later date and reactivate the account through the Activate/Inactivate SSO, Activate/Inactivate Admin, or Activate/Inactivate Operator functions of the Security module.\n User Profile Already Logged On  Whether or not a user profile can be logged on the system from multiple machines at the same time depends on its Multi Login field settings in the Security module. The value of this field is specified during the creation or modification of a user profile. It can be set to either Yes or No.\nIf the Mutli Login field is set to No, the user profile can be used to log on to CE through one machine only. Until the account is logged off, all attempts to access the same account through other machines are denied.\n Password Issues The common password issues encountered when attempting to log on to the CE system are:\n  Incorrect password;\n  Forgotten password; and\n  Expired password.\n  Incorrect Password  A user is automatically denied access to the system when the specified password on the CE Logon screen is incorrect. The user must simply try logging on again with a correct password. However, if the maximum number of failed logon attempts is reached, the account is automatically suspended. The error message displayed contains instructions on how to regain access to CE. These instructions depend on the system configuration.\nIf the Auto-reactivate feature is enabled, the error message displays the amount of time that the user must wait before the account becomes reactivated. Once the specified time has elapsed, the user can try to log on again.\nIf the Auto-reactivate feature is disabled, the error message instructs the user to contact the bank administrator for manual reactivation. The Bank administrator can then reactivate the suspended account through the Activate/Inactivate SSO, Activate/Inactivate Admin, or Activate/Inactivate Operator functions of the Security module.\n {width=\"0.3333333333333333in” height=\"0.3333333333333333in”}NOTE:\n i. The maximum number of failed logon attempts is defined through the MAX_LOGON_RETRIES security system parameter\nii. For details on how to enable or disable the Auto-reactivate feature, refer to the preceding Reactivating Locked Out Users topic of this chapter.\n Forgotten Password  In case of a forgotten account password, the I Forgot My Password link is provided in the CE Logon screen. Clicking on this link initiates the password reset process.\n {width=\"0.3333333333333333in” height=\"0.3333333333333333in”}NOTE: For details on the password reset process through the I Forgot My Password Link, refer to the CE Security and System Maintenance Functions manual.\nExpired Password  Once a user profile’s password expires, the user is denied access to CE. Whether or not the user can reset the account password upon expiration depends on the setting of the PSW_EXPIRED_CHANGE security system parameter. If this parameter is set to True, the user is prompted to reset the account password upon logon. If it is set to False, the user is not allowed to reset the password upon logon. The bank administrator must be contacted for further processing.\n {width=\"0.3333333333333333in” height=\"0.3333333333333333in”}NOTE: The number of days the password is valid for logging on to the system is defined through the PSW_EXPIRE_DAYS security system parameter.\nParameter Checklist for Security Vulnerabilities To prevent the potential for compromised integrity in the CE system, certain parameters must be configured to avoid security vulnerabilities.\nCookie Settings for HTTP Session\nIt is recommended to set the complete Domain and Secure cookie attributes in the Set-Cookie HTTP response header option. The Path cookie attribute must also be set to the context root (i.e. /CEWeb/).\nTo configure the Cookie settings:\n[IBM WebSphere]{.underline}\n Run the WebSphere Administrative console. In the Applications menu, expand the Application Types sub-menu and select the WebSphere enterprise applications option.    Click on the CE application link.    The configuration page for the CE application is shown. Select the Session Management option in the Web Module Properties section.    The configuration page for session manager properties is shown. In the Session tracking mechanism section, mark the corresponding Enable cookies option. To set the cookie path and attribute, click on the Enable cookies link.    The Cookie settings configuration page is displayed. Mark the following items to enable these options:    Restrict cookies to HTTPS sessions\n  Set session to HTTP Only to help prevent cross-site scripting attacks\n  In the Cookie path section, mark the following option to set the cookie path to the context root.\n Use the context root  Click on the OK button.\n  Click on the Save link to store the settings to the master configuration.

Specifically, both the SEC_BUSINESS_UNIT and SEC_BUSINESS_UNIT_TEMP tables in CE are automatically updated with this data from the back office system.\nIn the STP transaction component of the receiving CE function, include the following setting:\nstp.updateFieldValue(“L_DUAL_CTRL”, “F”);\nWith this setting, the master file is updated directly and regardless of the company profile (e.g., Authorize Transaction by Self).\nAssigning a Company Group to a Company Sent from EE The parent company or company group is manually assigned to a child company (record) that is sent by Eximbills Enterprise.\nIn the STP mapping rule related to the receiving function in CE, assign the actual company group name to the C_PARENT_ID tag via Value option in the STPs Receive Message dialog box.\n  Figure 5. STPs Mapping Function: C_PARENT_ID\nAlternatively, this assignment can be hard-coded in the XML file of the STP mapping rule:\nstp.updateFieldValue(“C_PARENT_ID”, “CS_Company_Group”);\nMQ Tool The MQ Message Toolkit, also known as the MQ Tool, is an external program that allows consultants to validate the GAPI parameters set in the CE Utility. This tool directly communicates with the IBM WebSphere MQ to perform interface scenarios such as verify the GAPI Parameters for outgoing CE messages, and verifying the GAPI and STP Parameters for demerging messages into CE transaction tables. In addition, the MQ Tool also has features that can be used to encrypt or decrypt data.\nBefore this tool can be utilized, the following settings are required:\n  The Java program must be installed in the system, and the JAVA_HOME environment variable must be defined.\n  The MQ tool must establish a connection with the WebSphere MQ.\n  {width=\"0.3333333333333333in” height=\"0.3333333333333333in”}NOTE: Windows 10 is used in the succeeding sample procedure.\nTo use the MQ Tool:\n Do the following … +———————–+———————–+———————–+ | 1.

An Eclipse-based open source reporting system for web applications, BIRT provides a variety of reporting design options and report patterns in different file output formats.\nThe BIRT tool is the primary report engine integrated with CE. Through the separately designed BIRT templates and parameter settings in CE, the relevant CE data is passed to the BIRT application, which in turn, facilitates the generation of reports and documents.\nThrough this reporting interface between CE and BIRT, the following functionalities are supported:\n  The PDF, EXCEL, and DOC (WORD) report and document formats are supported.\n  Reports can be generated dynamically according to parameter values defined at function setup or at runtime.\n  A standalone function for producing online transaction reports can be defined.\n  Batch reports are supported.\n  With the BIRT report engine, the CE system can support online and offline report and/or document generation. Online reports and documents are generated at runtime, such as upon transaction confirmation. Offline reports, on the other hand, are produced in batches according to a defined schedule in which all report data are collected.\nDocuments can also be generated as e-mail attachments that are sent out in batches.\nManual Overview  [Purpose]{.underline}\nThis manual is a comprehensive reference guide on the requirements and processes involved in building business products and functions that generate online reports and documents. This manual also covers basic BIRT settings.\nThis document is written with the assumption that the CE environment has already been successfully installed and the reader has sufficient knowledge of the following:\n   Building a CE product; and\n  Using the BIRT application, installing BIRT, and designing BIRT\n report templates.\n    [Audience]{.underline}\n This manual is a reference specifically for, but not limited to, the following users:\n  Consultants responsible for creating and configuring reports and document outputs\n  Bank or browser-side users tasked to process transactions involving reports.\n   [Prerequisites]{.underline}\n  Recommended references before reading this manual: CE Building a Product, CE Installation Guide, and CE Utility References  {width=\"0.3333333333333333in” height=\"0.3333333333333333in”}NOTE: Some features discussed in this manual have been tested and documented based on an older system version. Unless otherwise specified, the overall functionality is the same when recreated in the current version.\nUsing the CE Utility   RUNNING THE CE UTILITY\n  GENERATING THE XML PARAMETER FILES\n  BUILDING A PRODUCT\n  {#section-2 .CS-head1}\n{#section-3 .CS-head1}\n{#section-4 .CS-head1}\nRunning the CE Utility The Customer Enterprise Utility Workbench, or CE Utility, is the main tool for building parameters in CE.\nPreparing the CE Utility Files  Along with the installation files, the CE Utility folder is provided with every CE system release.

One step is the GAP analysis which involves an evaluation of transaction requirements, based on the process flow (e.g., fields, clauses, forms, and interfaces). These are necessary for identifying the fields required for anticipating the required output. When the analysis has been completed, the project team can now begin the process of building a product for the bank’s customers.\nThe following are steps in building a product:\n  Access the CE Utility. To access the CE Utility for building parameters, an Operator user must be created by an Administrator user. This is set up through the User Manager function in the User Manage function group.\n  Set up the module and events. This involves naming the module and the projected events that manage the transaction flow within the module. This is set up in the Module and Event function in CE Utility.\n  Set up the transaction tables. This involves creating the tables in the DB Dictionary function in CE Utility. There can be different types of tables but only three are mandatory for a CE module: master, ledger, and event.\n  {width=\"0.3333333333333333in” height=\"0.3333333333333333in”}NOTE: It is possible to create tables directly into the database by running SQL scripts in the database. In this case, tables can be created before modules and events. It is recommended, however, to use the DB Dictionary for creating tables.\n Add fields to the transaction table. Fields must be added to a transaction table and field properties defined for the processing and storage of data. These can be done through the DB Dictionary function in CE Utility.\n  Set up the transaction functions. This involves creating the functions that correspond to actual transaction processes. This is done through Transaction Function in the Transaction Function group.\n  Set up the transaction parameters. This involves designing the transaction screen, defining attribute and catalog settings, and attaching these parameters to the transaction function. These can be done through Transaction Function in CE Utility.\n  Create the product. The product is the actual functionality accessed and run by the end-user. This process of creating a product involves setting up the product group, product, and product function, and defining product catalog settings.\n  Define authorization rules. Authorization rules are set to further define or set limits for authorizing transactions.\n  Calculation. This involves configuring the transaction JS files and defining calculation functions using available system methods. There are three JS files that have to be configured: the Module Base JS file, Event JS file, and Function JS file.\n  Define the settings for the transaction input. Certain functions may be added to aid in the input of data into the transaction. The CE Utility provides options for setting up field conversion rules, lookup buttons, customer reference numbers, clauses, dropdown lists, and data objects for this purpose.\n  Define the settings for the transaction output. Some business transactions involve output generation (i.e., Forms). To make this option available, certain settings must be configured using the functions from the Transaction Function group in CE Utility.\n  Define the security settings in the CE browser. The products and functions created are assigned to an end-user through the browser-side Security and System Maintenance functions.\n  {width=\"0.3333333333333333in” height=\"0.3333333333333333in”}NOTE: The browser-side security and system maintenance functions of CE are often collectively called the Security Module.\nAdd the Inbox functionality. Another way of accessing a product or a transaction for further processing is through the Customer Inbox.

Template layouts can range from skeletal outlines with predefined themes to complete reports.\nThe BIRT Designer carries different tools that may be used in carrying out a report design. These are:\n  Layout Editor\n  Palette View\n  ####### Layout Editor\n The Layout Editor allows the user to place different design elements in the template. It is used mainly to construct the report and acts as a canvass for positioning and formatting report elements.\n   Figure 3. 12 Layout Editor\n Within the Layout Editor, the following tabs may be used to come up with a design suitable for the relevant business requirements: Layout, Master Page, Script, XML Source, and Preview.\n Layout Tab\nThis tab functions as a canvass and is used for the visual layout of the report. This supports drag-and-drop functionality wherein design elements from the palette may be dragged into the editor to build the required template layout.\n  Figure 3. 13 Layout Tab\nMaster Page\nThis tab is used for setting the header, footer, and background image configurations that are to be applied to the entire report. This page is often the location of the corporate header.\n  Figure 3. 14 Master Page\nScript Tab\nThis tab allows access to the JavaScript Editor. This is used to code event scripts for report templates and is typically used to add criteria in retrieving data.\n  Figure 3. 15 Script Tab\nXML Source\nThis tab displays the XML source code for the report design. This is automatically updated whenever design elements are added, edited, or deleted.\n  Figure 3. 16 XML Source tab\n{width=\"0.3333333333333333in” height=\"0.3333333333333333in”}NOTE: Though it is possible to modify the XML within this tab, it is better to use the layout view.\nPreview\nThis tab is used to preview the report output. This allows the report developer to quickly render a working report to HTML.\n  Figure 3. 17 Preview Tab\n{width=\"0.3333333333333333in” height=\"0.3333333333333333in”}NOTE: The Preview icon in the toolbar may also be used to view the reports in other supported formats.\n{width=\"1.4479166666666667in” height=\"0.5833333333333334in”}\n#######\n####### Palette View\n The Palette View contains the different design elements or report items that may be placed anywhere within the Layout page. It is also the main design layout tool for creating report templates.\nThe available design elements are Label, Text, Dynamic Text, Data, Image, Grid, List, Table, and Chart.\n Label\nThis is used for adding a single line of static text. The text can be externalized for localization and supports such properties as font sizing, highlighting, and usage as a hyperlink.\nTo use this report element, select it from the palette and place it within the Layout page.\n  Figure 3. 18 Label Design Element\nText\nThis is used to add a block of text. Though similar to Label, the Text may be in plain text or may display multi-line, highly formatted HTML. Values from existing data sets, parameters, JavaScript functions, and BIRT-specialized script functions may also be added into the formatted HTML using the BIRT Expression Builder.\nThis element can also be used to create scripts that are executed on the client side by using the tag. To use this report item, select it from the palette and place it within the Layout page. Use the Edit Text Item window to enter blocks of text using HTML codes.\n+——————————————————————-+ | \u003e {width=\"4.84375in” height=\"3.53125in”} | +——————————————————————-+\nFigure 3. 19 Text Design Element\nDynamic text\nThis is used to insert a block of text with optional CLOB data expressions. These values can also be combined with additional data using the BIRT Expression Builder.\nTo use this design element, select it from the palette and place it within the Layout page. Use the Expression Builder window to mix a block of static text with an expression.\n  Figure 3. 20 Dynamic Text Design Element\nData\nThis serves as the essential element for displaying values from data sources. Using the Expression Builder, data values may be altered and manipulated.\n[EXAMPLE: ]{.underline}\nIf a data set contains separate columns with different values, the values may be integrated into one data element using the Expression Builder.\nTo use this report item, select it from the palette and place it within the Layout page\n  Figure 3. 21 Data Design Element\nImage\nThis is used to include pictures in the report output. These images may be retrieved from a URI or embedded in the design, and it may include dynamic images (BLOB) from a data source or image files in a resource folder.\nTo use this design element, select it from the palette and place it within the Layout page.\n  Figure 3. 22 Image Design Element\nGrid\nThis element acts as a container for other report elements and is used to position elements in a logical manner. Grid elements are configured in tabular format.\n  Figure 3. 23 Grid Design Element\nList\nThis acts as a container for other elements. Lists iterate over data sets that are bound to the list. The default list element has a header, footer, and detail section. The header and footer are usually displayed once, while the detail section is displayed for every row of the data set that is bound to the list. Within the detail section, a text element or another container element may be added such as a grid, table, or another list.\n  Figure 3. 24 List Design Element\nTable\nSimilar to List, the Table design element is also a container element that iterates over bound data sets; the data, however, are represented in tabular format. The table element layout is similar to an HTML table. Table elements contain header, footer and detail sections as well as columns.\n  Figure 3. 25 Table Design Element\nChart\nThis inserts charts into the report template and chart values may be defined. The types of Chart are as follows:\n  Bar Chart\n  Line Chart\n  Area Chart\n  Pie Chart\n  Meter Chart\n  Scatter Chart\n  Stock Chart\n    Figure 3. 26 Chart Design Element\n{#section-11 .CS-head2}\nUsing Data Set Fields in the Template Layout  Data from created data sets may be incorporated into the template. Specifically, a field can be included in the template by dragging the selected field from the data set list into the layout page.\n {width=\"0.3333333333333333in” height=\"0.3333333333333333in”}NOTE: To include or delete fields within the data set, drag the data set into the template and individually delete the fields that are not to be included.\n  Figure 3. 27 Using the Data Set Fields into the Template Layout\nProducing CE Documents   OVERVIEW\n  PARAMETER SETTINGS\n  Overview  A document generally refers to a report form that displays transaction details based on the defined Form and Report Template settings.

Through CE’s integration with the BIRT report engine, a standalone report function for generating transaction reports can be created; this provides real-time data queries for business research and analysis. This report can also be set up to allow the end-user to specify the parameters by which the report is generated.\nThe BIRT template, on which the CE online transaction report is to be based, must already be designed and reside in the relevant CE directory of the application server.\n+———————————————————————–+ | Transaction Processing Example | | | | Run the Report function.

It is used to define the parameters that are required to carry out business operations and system tasks in CE. Using the CE Utility, parameters may be customized according to specific business requirements.\nThe CE Utility is managed by a set of users: the Super Administrator, the Administrator, and the Operator. System administration tasks, such as configuring bank-country group settings, defining data sources, setting global system parameters, and creating new Super Administrator users, may be performed only by a Super Administrator user. Administrator and Operator users, on the other hand, manage and configure parameter settings.\nSystem Administration functions, or those handled by a super administrator, are classified in the CE Utility into two main function groups: User Manage and Parameter Manage.\nThe User Manage function group pertains to functions that are used for creating and configuring bank-country groups and data sources; creating other Super Administrator users; and creating Administrator users and assigning their functions\nThe Parameter Manage function group pertains to functions that are used for the maintenance of global system parameters and Language records.\n{width=\"0.3298611111111111in” height=\"0.3298611111111111in”}NOTE:\ni. The default Super Administrator logon details in the CE Utility are as follows:\n- User ID: superadmin\n- Password: db2admin\nii. The settings that are made by a CE Utility super administrator define certain scopes and limitations in the parameters that apply on the browser side of the CE system.\nManual Overview Purpose\nThis manual is a reference for the default Super Administrator user of the CE Utility in the configuration and maintenance of the CE environment. It discusses in detail user management and parameter management.\nAudience\nThis document serves as a guide specifically for, but not limited to, the following users:\n  Users in-charge of the installation and setup of the CE environment; and\n  Users involved in the management, maintenance, and use of the CE Utility.\n   [Prerequisites]{.underline}\n Sufficient knowledge of the CE system is required.

One step is the GAP analysis which involves an evaluation of transaction requirements, based on the process flow (e.g., fields, clauses, forms, and interfaces). These are necessary for identifying the fields required for anticipating the required output. When the analysis has been completed, the project team can now begin the process of building a product for the bank’s customers.\nThe following are steps in building a product:\n  Access the CE Utility. To access the CE Utility for building parameters, an Operator user must be created by an Administrator user. This is set up through the User Manager function in the User Manage function group.\n  Set up the module and events. This involves naming the module and the projected events that manage the transaction flow within the module. This is set up in the Module and Event function in CE Utility.\n  Set up the transaction tables. This involves creating the tables in the DB Dictionary function in CE Utility. There can be different types of tables but only three are mandatory for a CE module: master, ledger, and event.\n  {width=\"0.3333333333333333in” height=\"0.3333333333333333in”}NOTE: It is possible to create tables directly into the database by running SQL scripts in the database. In this case, tables can be created before modules and events. It is recommended, however, to use the DB Dictionary for creating tables.\n Add fields to the transaction table. Fields must be added to a transaction table and field properties defined for the processing and storage of data. These can be done through the DB Dictionary function in CE Utility.\n  Set up the transaction functions. This involves creating the functions that correspond to actual business transaction processes. This is done through Transaction Function in the Transaction Function group.\n  Set up the transaction parameters. This involves designing the transaction screen, defining attribute and catalog settings, and attaching these parameters to the transaction function. These can be done through Transaction Function in CE Utility.\n  Create the product. The product is the actual functionality accessed and run by the end-user. This process of creating a product involves setting up the product group, product, and product function, and defining product catalog settings.\n  Define authorization rules. Authorization rules are set to further define or set limits for authorizing transactions.\n  Calculation. This involves configuring the transaction JS files and defining calculation functions using available system methods. There are three JS files that have to be configured: the Module Base JS file, Event JS file, and Function JS file.\n  Define the settings for the transaction input. Certain functions may be added to aid in the input of data into the transaction. The CE Utility provides options for setting up field conversion rules, lookup buttons, customer reference numbers, clauses, dropdown lists, and data objects for this purpose.\n  Define the settings for the transaction output. Some business transactions involve output generation (i.e., Forms). To make this option available, certain settings must be configured using the functions from the Transaction Function group in CE Utility.\n  Define the security settings in the CE browser. The products and functions created are assigned to an end-user through the browser-side Security and System Maintenance functions.\n  {width=\"0.3333333333333333in” height=\"0.3333333333333333in”}NOTE: The browser-side security and system maintenance functions of CE are often collectively called the Security Module.\nAdd the Inbox functionality. Another way of accessing a product or a transaction for further processing is through the Customer Inbox. This can be set up through the Inbox function in CE Utility.  {width=\"0.3333333333333333in” height=\"0.3333333333333333in”}NOTE: For more details on configuring different parameters in CE, refer to the CE Utility Reference manuals*.*\n{#section-4 .CS-ChapterTitle}\nUser Management Functions   introduction to the user management functions\n  business unit config\n  data source manage\n  import / export business unit\n  user manage\n  Introduction to the User Management Functions The User Manage function group consists of functions used for creating, configuring, and exporting Bank Group - Country setups; creating new users and assigning access rights; and configuring data sources.\nThe functions that are available in this function group depend on the type of CE Utility user that is logged on the system.

These are:\n  the Security Data Source, which is used to store security data;\n  the Meta Data Source, which is used to store CE Utility parameters; and\n  the Transaction Data Source, which is used to store transaction data.\n  Each of the data sources is partitioned into several schemas, which group together the data that are classified under the information type of the data source.\nThe CE Utility must be properly configured to the correct data sources. This is done through the Data Source Manage function. Moreover, this function is used to identify the Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) data source in the application server to the system.\nThis function consists of two tabs: Transaction Data Source Manager and Utility Data Source Manager.\n  Figure 3.
